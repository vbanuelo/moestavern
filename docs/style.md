# Moe's Tavern – Style Guide

Here, you will find a guide for styling revisions and additions to the Moe's Tavern website. As a general rule, keep in mind that the website is designed from the idiosyncratic point of view of the character Moe from _The Simpsons_, so keep this in mind as you proceed.<br>
The following is organized by topic for ease of use. <br>

## Color Palette

Moe's Tavern is neon and dirty, but full of character. Our color selections intend to reflect this:

  - Color: rgb(235, 241, 236)

## Fonts and Typography

Our site is styled using Times New Roman, as we discussed other options and came to the conclusion that Moe would likely use what's widely considered the "default" font for his website.

## Logo Usage

All logos and likenesses are property of the Walt Disney Company. When possible, we have used screenshots from episodes of the show and edited them to the appropriate sizes and resolutions for the **Menu** and **Not Allowed!** pages.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

Again, as the narrative of the site is that this has been created by the character depicted on the homepage, pages should be written from the perspective of the character doing his best to be professional \(but occasionally failing\). For example of his literal voice, click on the red telephone at the bottom of the **Not Allowed!** page for recordings. The occasional \("intentional"\) typo is encouraged.

## Accessibility Rules

For accessibility, see the above style guide for color changes on hovering. Further emphasizing changes can be found in the live CSS file. Keep in mind that the inaccessibility should be narrative only: the hovering should ameliorate the hideousness that the unskilled-in-graphic-design character has "chosen". As there is a lot of repetition of imagery and characters, be very detailed with your alt text.
