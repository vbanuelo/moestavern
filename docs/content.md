### 3.2 `menu.html` – Menu

**Page Goal:**  
Show off Moe’s drink and snack offerings using fun, show-inspired names and images.

**General Guidelines**

- Keep each item short and punchy.
- Every item should have:
  - **Name**
  - **Short description** (1–2 sentences)
  - Optional: small joke or reference.
- Use both real-world and cartoon-style items:
  - Real recipes that exist in actual restaurants are welcome.
  - Cartoon-only items can have a playful disclaimer (e.g., “Please don’t actually try this at home.”)

1. **Page Heading**

   - Example:
     - `Moe’s Menu`
     - Subtitle: `Drinks, snacks, and highly questionable cocktails.`

2. **Menu Items**

   - Create cards or blocks for:
     - **Flaming Moe**
       - Description idea:
         > The legendary, totally not stolen, concoction that put Moe’s on the map. Fiery, mysterious, and probably not FDA-approved.
     - **Duff Beer**
       - Description idea:
         > Springfield’s favorite lager. Cold, foamy, and suspiciously cheap.
     - **Non-Alcoholic Option**
       - Description idea:
         > For designated drivers, kids, or people who lost a bet with Marge.
     - **Pickled Eggs**
       - Description idea:
         > Classic bar jar special. Probably older than Bart.
     - **Pretzel Bowl**
       - Description idea:
         > Perfect for soaking up regret and Duff.

3. **Custom / Expandable Items**

   - A short note to contributors:
     > “This menu is meant to grow over time. Add new items as you discover more Simpsons-inspired recipes or create your own.”

4. **User Feedback Note**
   - A single line:
     > “Got an idea for a new item? Let Moe know — unless it’s a prank call.”

### 3.3 `notallowed.html` – Not Allowed List

**Page Goal:**  
Provide a humorous list of people who have been banned from Moe’s Tavern and why.

**Tone**

- Extra sarcastic and Moe-like.
- Short, punchy entries that feel like grievances.

**Suggested Structure**

1. **Page Heading**

   - Example:
     - `Not Allowed in Moe’s Tavern`
     - Subtitle: `The wall of shame for Springfield’s worst customers.`

2. **Intro Text**

   - 1–2 sentences explaining:
     - This is the list of folks who have wronged Moe.
     - The list will grow as Moe loses patience with more people.
   - Example:
     > Some people are such rotten customers that even Moe has standards. Here’s the list of bozos who are banned until further notice (or until they bring cash).

3. **List Entries**

   - Each entry should have:
     - **Name**
     - **Reason / Incident**
     - **Possible Picture**
   - Example entries:
     - **Homer Simpson**
       > Permanently on thin ice for starting bar fights, unpaid tabs, and that one time he almost burned the place down. Still allowed… most of the time.
     - **Barney Gumble**
       > Banned every other week for reasons we no longer discuss in polite company.
     - **Prank Callers (Yes, You)**
       > “Is there a ‘Seymour Butz’ here?” — very funny. You’re on the list.

4. **Future Entries Note**
   - A short, in-character note:
     > “This list gets longer every time someone calls asking for ‘I.P. Freely.’ You’ve been warned.”

## 4. Content Checklist

When adding or editing content:

- [ ] Is the tone consistent with Moe / Springfield humor?
- [ ] Are references understandable to someone who has seen a few episodes?
- [ ] Are important details (like headings and labels) still clear?
- [ ] Is the text short enough to be scanned quickly?

If the answer is “yes” to most of these, you’re keeping the Moe’s Tavern spirit alive.
