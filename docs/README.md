# Moe's tavern

This project was made as a dedicated page to Moe's Tavern - history, menu, and fun times.

## Index

The Index page is the intro to the website. The page has been developed with The Simpson's tv show in mind. The background image chosen for the site was intentional to show the reader the actual bar from the show.

### Styling

    -The colors chosen were to compliment the colors chosen for the bar.
    -The page is written for those that have watched the show, there are specific words and legitimate typos that play to the way that Moe speaks.
    -The green highlight was to make the page interactive so that the reader would know that the programmers want to interact with them.
    -User feedback has been taken into consideration with making changes to enhance the page.

## Menu

    -The colors here are complimentary to the homepage.
    -The menu has been presented using images of both real photos and drawn images. The real photos are recipes that have been realized in actual restaurants.
    -This page is meant to be edited and we need to add items as necessary.
    -Again user feedback is asked for.

## Not Allowed

    -This page is dedicated to all those that have wronged Moe in some way.
    - Although Moe wants to restrict Homer at all times, other than Barney, Homer is Moe's best customer. One could say Homer is his best friend.
    -This number of entries will increase as Moe decides who he will no longer allow in his tavern.
